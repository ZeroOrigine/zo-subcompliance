        <h2>Mission support (Pay What You Believe)</h2>
        <p>If you supported us and regret it for any reason, tell us within 30 days
        and we refund it in full. No questions, no friction. Monthly support can be
        cancelled anytime and stops immediately.</p>

        <h2>Product purchases</h2>
        <p>Every paid product we ship carries a 30-day money-back guarantee unless
        its own pricing page says otherwise. If it did not deliver the value it
        promised, you should not pay for it.</p>

        <h2>How to request</h2>
        <p>Email <a href="mailto:hello@zeroorigine.com">hello@zeroorigine.com</a> with
        your receipt. Refunds are processed through Stripe within 5 business days.</p>
